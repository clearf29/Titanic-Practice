# Titanic-Practice
I am using this project as a way to fine tune my Data Science skills, learn more through consistent practice.
I am using google colab because of its flexibility and ability to keep easily retrievable projects. 
Also, this is just part of learning to make use of Git and Github, almost like a beginner. 
The machine learning classification problem aims at predicting the number of passengers who surivived and those who died.
Therefore, while modeling the data, the dependent variable is the survived column.
